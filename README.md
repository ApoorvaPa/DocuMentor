#  DocuMentor: Document Question Answering Simplified

**DocuMentor** will be an open source Question-Asnwering service used to query from PDFs and JPGs using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. It will support real-time, document-grounded responses by coordinating modular tools through a unified interface, including OCR, vector search, and large language models (LLMs). It will at the end be deployed as a microservice.
